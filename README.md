## ðŸŽ® How to Play (in German)

1.  The game will prompt you to guess a number: `Rate eine Zahl zwischen 1 und 10: ` (Guess a number between 1 and 10).
2.  Enter your guess and press Enter.
3.  **If correct:** You win! (`Richtig! ðŸŽ‰`) and the game ends.
4.  **If incorrect:** The correct number is revealed, and you are asked if you want to play again: `Erneut Versuchen? [y|n]: ` (Try again? [y|n]).
    * Enter `y` to start a new round with a new random number.
    * Enter `n` to quit the game (`Das Spiel wird beendet.`).
